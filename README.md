# Certmagic Storage Backend for Google Cloud Storage 

Note: This repository will eventually become public.

This library allows you to use Google Cloud Storage as key/certificate storage backend for your [Certmagic](https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic)-enabled HTTPS server. To protect your keys from unwanted attention, client-side encryption is possible.
